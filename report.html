      <p>Portfolio Website Development Report</p>

    <main>
      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This report details the development process of my portfolio website.
          It covers the design, features, and web site architecture. I
          implemented curious features to moke the website scalable and
          extensible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="inspiration">
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          I wasn't inspired by any web site portfolios. I have been creating the
          design and different features based on my own vision and 2 years of
          experience in web development. I understood that basically I need a
          navigation bar, and tabs for different sections. With the help of
          which user can be redirected to the desired section. Therefore it was
          my starting point in the development of the website.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="accessibility">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>To ensure accessibility, I implemented the following features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Alternative Text for Images:</strong> All images include
            descriptive alt text, ensuring that screen readers can accurately
            convey the content of the images to visually impaired users.

            <img src="/assets/img/alternative-text-evidence.png" />
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="usability">
        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <p>I considered usability in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Intuitive Navigation:</strong> The site’s navigation is
            straightforward, with clearly labeled links and a consistent
            structure throughout the pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The site automatically adjusts
            to fit different screen sizes, ensuring that it is user-friendly on
            desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="learning">
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Three key things I had to learn or find out to create my site were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>JS Models and proporties in Browser environment</strong>
            I learned how to use JS modules and their differences from
            "text/javascript" scripts. I dig into the browser environment and
            learned how to maniplate the DOM. I learned how to use different
            events and how to handle them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML Tags and its proporties</strong>
            Also script tags async and defer were new to me. I learned different
            html tags I never ever used before and familiarized myself with
            their properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Time, efforts, and feature importance and management</strong
            >
            Apart from the technical part, I learned how to manage my time and
            not to spend too much time on the feature that is not so important
            right now. I learned how to not deep dive and focus on the one
            feature, but to create an overall picture of the website and return
            to the feature later on, if I would have enough time for that.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="evaluation1">
        <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
        <p>I believe the most successful aspects of my work include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean and Modern Design:</strong> The overall aesthetic is
            clean and modern, which aligns with current design trends and makes
            the site visually appealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsive Layout:</strong> The site’s ability to adapt to
            different devices without compromising the user experience is a
            major success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The possility to furter easily extend the website</strong>
            I wrote my small framework based on fetch API. It allows me to
            easily import html files to other html files. Not only that, but the
            import function allows me to pass the script that will be executed
            after the html file is mounted to the DOM.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="evaluation2">
        <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
        <p>Areas for improvement include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Refactoring</strong>
            JavaScript is well known as a language of anarchists. Because of its
            flexibility, it is very easy to mess up the code, while hitting the
            deadlines. I need to deeply refactor the code and restructurize it.
            A lot of things can be improved and polished.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced Interactivity:</strong> I could explore more
            advanced interactivity, such as adding dynamic elements using
            JavaScript to improve user engagement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Animated and interactive background</strong>
            Initially I wanted to create animated gradient blobs at the
            background. But I decided to postpone this feature for the future.
            And I want to find an elegant and optimized way how to mock
            physically realistical blobs.
          </li>
        </ul>
